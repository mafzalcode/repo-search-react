**Project Description**

This React application, created using Vite and Jest, is a simple GitHub repository search tool. The user can input the name of the author and repository they are searching for, and the app will fetch data from the GitHub API to display information such as the name, author, number of stars and forks, and popularity of the repository. The popularity is determined by a simple algorithm that gives extra weight to the number of forks, with a score of 500 or higher considered popular.

**Assumptions Made**

During the development of this project, the following assumptions were made:

- The GitHub API is available and will return data in the expected format.
- The user has a valid GitHub access token that can be used for API requests.
- The user is looking for a specific repository by name and author, rather than searching for a list of repositories that match certain criteria.
- The popularity of a repository is determined solely by its number of stars and forks, and not by other factors such as issues or pull requests.

**Environment Setup and Local Service Execution**

To prepare the environment and run the service locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the command line and navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run **npm install** to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Create a **.env** file in the root directory and add your GitHub access token as follows:
```
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
```

1. Run **npm run dev** to start the development server.
2. Open your browser and navigate to **http://localhost:5173/** to view the app.

**Potential Improvements**

Given more time, here are some potential improvements that could be made to the app:

- Error handling: The app currently only displays a message if the API request fails. More detailed error messages could be provided to help the user understand what went wrong.
- More data: The app currently only displays a limited amount of data about the repository. More information could be added, such as the number of open issues or pull requests, to give the user a more complete picture of the repository.
- Pagination: If the user searches for a very popular repository, the API may return a large amount of data. Pagination could be implemented to prevent the app from slowing down or crashing in this scenario.
- User authentication: Currently, the app assumes that the user has a valid GitHub access token. Adding user authentication would allow the app to use the user's token instead, which could improve performance and allow for more requests.
- Improved design: The current design is very basic and could be improved to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.
